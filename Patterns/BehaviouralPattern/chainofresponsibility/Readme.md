# Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
> #### ➡ The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until it is handled by an appropriate object.

#
### How the Chain of Responsibility Pattern Works 🔧
> #### 1. Handler Interface
> #### 2. Concrete Handlers

#
### Adavantages of Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
> #### ➡  Dynamic Request Handling: The pattern allows requests to be passed along the chain dynamically until a suitable handler is found. This ensures that each request is handled appropriately, even as the system evolves.
> #### ➡  Improved Code Organization & Maintainability: Instead of managing complex if-else conditions, each handler encapsulates its own logic. This modularity leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.

#
### Real-life Use Cases of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern 🌎
> #### 1.  Technical Support: A customer’s issue is escalated from Level 1 support to higher levels until someone can resolve it.
> #### 2.  Logging Systems: Log messages pass through various loggers based on severity (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).
> #### 3.  ATM
> #### 4.  Authentication: A request is passed through several filters to validate credentials and permissions.
