# Iterator Design Pattern
> #### âž¡ The Iterator pattern is a widely used design pattern in software development that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object (such as a list or collection) sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
> #### âž¡ It defines a separate object, called an iterator, which encapsulates the details of traversing the elements of the aggregate, allowing the aggregate to change its internal structure without affecting the way its elements are accessed.

### Real-life Use Cases of the Iterator Pattern ðŸŒŽ
> #### 1. Database Records: Iterating over a result set in a database query.
> #### 2. Menu Items in Applications: Iterating through menu items in a GUI (e.g., navigating through options).
> #### 3. Game Object Iteration: Iterating over game objects (like characters or items) in a game loop.
