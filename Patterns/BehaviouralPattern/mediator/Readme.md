# Mediator Design Pattern
> #### âž¡ The Mediator Design Pattern simplifies communication between multiple objects in a system by centralizing their interactions through a mediator. Instead of objects interacting directly, they communicate via a mediator, reducing dependencies and making the system easier to manage.
> #### âž¡ It promotes loose coupling by preventing them  from refering to each ohter.
