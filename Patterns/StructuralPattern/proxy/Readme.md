# Proxy Design Pattern
> #### ➡  Proxy Design Pattern provides a surrogate (act on behalf of other) or placeholder for another object to control access to it. Proxy means “in place of” or “representing” or “on behalf of”
> #### ➡   It controls the access to object.

#

### Advantage ofProxy Design Pattern
> #### ➡ Centralized Access Control: The proxy manages access rules, ensuring consistent and secure access to the real service.
> #### ➡ 2. Caching: Frequently requested videos can be cached in the proxy, reducing bandwidth usage and improving performance.
> #### ➡ 3. Request Limiting: The proxy can enforce limits on user requests, preventing abuse of the service.
> #### ➡ 4. Scalability: Adding new access rules or optimizations requires changes only in the proxy, leaving the real service untouched.

### Real-life Use Cases of the Proxy Pattern 🌎
> #### 1. Proteected Proxies: Control access to sensitive resources, ensuring only authorized users can access them.
> #### 2. Caching Proxies: Cache frequently requested data, improving performance and reducing load on the server.
> #### 3. Virtual Proxies: Delay the creation of expensive objects until they are actually needed.
