# Memento Design Pattern
> #### ➡ The Memento Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that helps save and restore an object's state without exposing its internal details. 
> #### ➡ It is like a "snapshot" that allows you to roll back changes if something goes wrong. 
> #### ➡ It is widely used in undo-redo functionality in applications like text editors or games.

> #### 2. Configuration Management: Save configurations or settings before making changes so that you can revert back if something goes wrong. ⚙️🔙
> #### 3.  Financial Transactions: Maintain snapshots of account states before transactions to support rollbacks in case of errors.
