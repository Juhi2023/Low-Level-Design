# Observe Design Pattern
> #### âž¡ The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. 
> #### âž¡ When one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. It primarily deals with the interaction and communication between objects, specifically focusing on how objects behave in response to changes in the state of other objects.

### Advantages
> #### 1. Decoupling: The YouTubeChannel doesnâ€™t need to know what each observer does. It just notifies them about the update. ðŸŽ¯
> #### 2. Scalability: Adding new types of observers (e.g., email, SMS) is as simple as implementing the Subscriber interface. ðŸ“ˆ
> #### 3. Flexibility: Observers can join or leave at any time without affecting the YouTubeChannel. ðŸ”„
> #### 4. Maintainability: The YouTubeChannel stays clean and simple, while the observers handle their own logic. ðŸ”§

### Real-life Use Cases of the Observer Pattern ðŸŒŽ
> #### 1. Social Media Notifications: When someone you follow posts something, you get a notification.
> #### 2. Stock Market Alerts: When stock prices change, you are notified.
> #### 3. Weather Apps: The app notifies you about weather changes.
> #### 4. Message Systems: When a new message arrives, all subscribers are notified.
