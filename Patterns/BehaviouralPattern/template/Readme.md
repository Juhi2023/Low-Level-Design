# Template Design Pattern
> #### âž¡ The Template Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the basic structure of an algorithm in a superclass, while allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations of certain steps of the algorithm without modifying its overall structure. 
> #### âž¡ It promotes code reuse and enforces a common algorithm structure across multiple subclasses.


#
### When to use Template Design Pattern
> #### âž¡ Common Algorithm with Variations: When an algorithm has a common structure but differs in some steps or implementations, the Template Method pattern can help subclasses customize specific parts while encapsulating the common phases in a superclass.
> #### âž¡ Code Reusability: By specifying the common steps in one place, the Template Method design encourages code reuse when you have similar tasks or processes that must be executed in several contexts.
> #### âž¡ Enforcing Structure: It's useful when you want to provide some elements of an algorithm flexibility while maintaining a particular structure or set of steps.

### Real-life Use Cases of the Template Pattern ðŸŒŽ
> #### 1. Cooking Recipes: Just like our beverage example, many recipes follow a standard process with customizable ingredients.
> #### 2. Game Development : Think of a game loop where the framework handles common tasks (updating, rendering) while letting you override specific game mechanics.
> #### 3. User Interface Rendering : A base UI component might define the general layout, but specific components can override how they render content.
