# Abstract Factory Design Pattern
> #### ‚û° Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying the concrete classes.
#

### Components of Abstract Factory Pattern
> #### 1. Abstract Products
> #### 2. Concrete Products
> #### 3. Abstract Factory
> #### 4. Concrete Factory

### Advantages
>#### 1. Easier to Extend:
Adding new car brands (or any other related products) is as simple as adding a new concrete factory. You don‚Äôt need to touch the client code or the existing factories.

>#### 2. ‚ÄçCleaner and More Maintainable

#
### Real-life Use Cases of the Strategy Pattern üåé
> #### 1. Cross-Platform UI Libraries: If you‚Äôre developing a cross-platform application, you can use an Abstract Factory to create platform-specific UI elements (buttons, windows, textboxes) for Windows, Mac, or Android, ensuring consistency across platforms.

> #### 2. Database Connections: In a multi-database system, you can use an Abstract Factory to create database connections for different databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.

### Factory Method vs. Abstract Factory
#### 1. Purpose:
‚óã Factory Method: Creates one type of object.

‚óã Abstract Factory: Creates families of related objects.

‚Äç

#### 2. Scope: 

‚óã Factory Method: Focuses on creating a single product.

‚óã Abstract Factory: Creates multiple related products.

‚Äç

#### 3. Abstraction Level: 

‚óã Factory Method: Deals with one product type at a time.

‚óã Abstract Factory: Deals with groups of related products.

‚Äç

#### 4. Example: 

‚óã Factory Method: A CarFactory creates one type of car.

‚óã Abstract Factory: A VehicleFactory creates cars, trucks, and bikes of the same brand.

‚Äç

#### 5. Flexibility: 

‚óã Factory Method: Adding new products requires changing the factory.

‚óã Abstract Factory: Adding new families doesn't affect existing code.

‚Äç

#### 6. Use Case: 

‚óã Factory Method: When you need to create a single object (e.g., one car model).

‚óã Abstract Factory: When you need to create related objects (e.g., different vehicles from the same brand).
