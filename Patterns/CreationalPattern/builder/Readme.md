# Builder Design Pattern
> #### âž¡ The Builder Design Pattern is so named because it allows you to build an object step-by-step. The builder is responsible for assembling an object, and you control the process by setting attributes one by one. 
> #### âž¡ Instead of passing all parameters in a constructor, you pass only the ones you care about, and the builder takes care of the rest
#
### Problems it solve
> #### âž¡ Passing Unnecessary Values (Optional value in constructer)
> #### âž¡ Constructor Overloading and Huge Combinations
> #### âž¡ Mutable objects

#
### Real-life Use Cases of the Builder Pattern ðŸŒŽ
> #### 1. Building Complex Meals: Imagine creating a custom meal order (e.g., selecting burger size, toppings, drinks). The Builder Pattern lets you choose only the options you care about, making the process cleaner.
> #### 2. User Profile Creation: When building user profiles in apps, where there are multiple options (name, email, preferences), the Builder Pattern allows customization without cluttering the code.
