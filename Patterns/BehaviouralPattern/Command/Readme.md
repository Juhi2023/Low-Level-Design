# Command Design Pattern
> #### âž¡ The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object called a command. With the help of this pattern, you can capture each component of a request, including the object that owns the method, the parameters for the method, and the method itself.
> #### âž¡ The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for the separation of sender and receiver.
> #### âž¡ Commands can be parameterized, meaning you can create different commands with different parameters without changing the invoker.
> #### âž¡ The pattern supports undoable operations by storing the state or reverse commands.
