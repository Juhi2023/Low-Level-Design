// Benefits of Thread Pools üåü 
// 1. Resource Management: Limit the number of threads to prevent system overload. üõë 
// 2. Performance Improvement: Reuse existing threads instead of creating new ones. ‚ö° 
// 3. Predictability: Control thread creation and scheduling for better application behavior. üìä 
// 4. Task Management: Queuing, scheduling, and monitoring tasks becomes streamlined. üìã
